!! IMPORTANT:
Create a branch when you are not sure if your code is correct. you can do that in cli by the following command:

git branch <branch name>
git checkout <branch name>

do all your works in that branch, add files and push and after all that in the website u can create a pull request, this will notify the other person that a fellow peer has done something that he wants you to verify, u can see what new changes he has made, and that way discussions can happer easier

Once done, the pull request is merged to the main master branch by the merge pull request button that will appear after creating the pull request, after clicking that all changes are made to the master branch.

Apparently in an actual office, every person is assigned a code reviewer, this way whatever one does is cross verified
